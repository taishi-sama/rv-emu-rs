# What is it.
My small personal project targeted to write RISC-V emulator with decent accuracy.

Current target instruction set is rv32ima(unfinished), have plans to implement virtual memory, user mode and etc.


Devices list contains only write-only simple UART device and write-only audio device with fixed rate and format. Will be extended in the future.


# Credits 
## Emulation
Project was heavely inspired by [mini-rv32ima emulator](https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima).

elf_analyzer.rs and some parts of code was took from [riscv-rust emulator](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu). Corresponding license is located in OTHER_LICENSES folder.


## Bad Apple example
Rights to "Bad Apple!!" is owned by Alstroemeria Records
bad_apple/Bad Apple!!.ogg was ripped from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8).
